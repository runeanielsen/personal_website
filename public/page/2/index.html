                <h2 class="post__title">What is &#39;this&#39; in JavaScript</h2>
                <p class="post__description">In a language like C# &#39;this&#39; always points to the containing class, so going into JavaScript you might think that &#39;this&#39; always points to the containing function, but this is not the case. Sometimes you will find &#39;this&#39; actually pointing to the function, but other times you will find it pointing to the global object or to something third. In this post, I will go through the rules of how the &#39;this&#39; binding is being set, so hopefully, development in JavaScript using the &#39;this&#39; keyword will get easier and less confusing.</p>

                <p class="post__description">A lot of developers today write their styles in a transpiled language like Sass or Less. Creating a setup is needed to transpile, bundle and minify the code. In this post I will show you how to setup a build flow with Webpack 2, to transpile, bundle, minify and add vendor specific CSS to the final bundle.</p>

                <p class="post__description">ASP.NET Core comes with a cookie middleware system that can be used without ASP.NET Core Identity. The reason to use cookie authentication instead of ASP.NET core identity is that you want to provide your own database and login implementation.</p>
