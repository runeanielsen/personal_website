                <h2 class="post__title">Async await in JavaScript</h2>
                <p class="post__description">Async/await is a way to handle asynchronous code in JavaScript. Before async/await the only options were to use callbacks and promises resulting in highly nested structures. The benefit of using async/await is that it creates a cleaner way to structure asynchronous code without having to rely on nested callbacks or confusing promise chains.</p>

                <p class="post__description">Instead of using the good old XMLHttp Request Object in JavaScript. ES6 introduce the concept of Fetch. Fetch provides a cleaner interface for retrieving resources from both internal, but also external sources. The interface will seem familiar to the XMLHttpRequest, but Fetch has both a more powerful and flexible feature set.</p>

                <p class="post__description">ES6 came with a new type of function called a generator. A generator in JavaScript is a function that can be entered and exited that saves its current state across multiple re-enterings of the function. In this blog post, I will go over how to create a generator and how to use it. In the end of the post, I will show a use-case where a generator function can be applied.</p>

                <h2 class="post__title">Promises in JavaScript</h2>
                <p class="post__description">In JavaScript, the most common way to retrieve data is though calling an API. Calling an API is in most cases done asynchronously instead of synchronously to create the best user experience and making it possible to call multiple APIs at the same time. The standard way to call an API asynchronous is by using function callbacks. The problem with the function callback is that it is likely to introduce big nested callback chains that can be hard to debug and maintain. The new and superior way to handle asynchronous code is by using promises.</p>

                <p class="post__description">Working with collections are a daily task, as a programmer. JavaScript uses the Array as the main type of collection. In this blog post, I will go over the methods on the array that I find most useful. Hopefully, the introduction to the methods will be increasing your productivity, working with collections and increasing the readability and maintainability of your code.</p>

                <h2 class="post__title">JavaScript closure</h2>
                <p class="post__description">In JavaScript when a function is nested inside of another function, the inner function has access to the outer function scope. The innermost function has access to all the parent scopes and therefore has closure over all of them. Because the inner function has closure over the parent functions, it is able to use the variables, even when the function has returned.</p>

                <p class="post__description">In this blog post, I will explain how the lexical scoping model is defined and how it is being used in JavaScript. I will go over how the lexical scope differs from the dynamic scoping model by using the example of the how the execution of a JavaScript program would look like if it was using the dynamic scoping model and after that showing how it is done in JavaScript using the lexical scoping model.</p>

                <p class="post__description">To efficiently program in javascript you will have to understand the principle of scope. The javascript scope is the set of variables you have access to, this goes for both objects and functions since in javascript functions and objects are also variables. To better understand scope we will have to look into how javascript is being executed. By taking a look at the compiler, engine and the scope.</p>

                <p class="post__description">When you&#39;re building a web application it is important to be able to control the service lifetime of the registrations in your container. The reason is that some of your objects might require being instantiated on every request while another instance should be unique and should only be instantiated once in the application lifespan.</p>

                <h2 class="post__title">Hoisting in JavaScript</h2>
                <p class="post__description">In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used. In other words, a variable can be used before it has been declared, this is called hoisting. The term hoisting cannot be found in the official JavaScript documents, but the term was invented as a general way of thinking about what happens in the compilation phase when variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope. To be exact the variables are not being moved to the top of the scope, but they&#39;re being stored in memory doing the compile phase, so they can be used in the execution phase.</p>
